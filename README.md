# Portfolio Diversification with Emerging Market Bonds
EM bonds, with a larger allocation to Chinese bonds, offer significant diversification benefits to a global portfolio of financial assets. We analyse the quantum of this diversification benefit using frequentist and Bayesian data science modeling in Python, under the classic mean-variance portfolio optimization framework.

Frequentist tests on equality of variances mostly rejected the null hypothesis that increased EM bond exposure did not reduce the portfolio's expected volatility. Bayesian modeling then allowed for a more precise estimate of the volatility reduction generated by an increased allocation to EM bonds.
